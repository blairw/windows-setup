        "3. At the command prompt, enter: `OOBE\\BYPASSNRO` (yes, without any spaces; yes, with a backslash)\n",
        "    - This will trigger a reboot, this is expected behaviour.\n",
        "4. In the now-rebooted OOBE, again, do not connect any network cables and do not connect to WiFi.\n",
        "    - Use <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd> again to pull up a command prompt again\n",
        "    - This time: `ipconfig /release`\n",
        "5. Now, during this OOBE second run, you will be allowed to click **I don't have Internet** when prompted to connect to the Internet\n",
