### Nextcloud Calendar

Windows Calendar isn't that great; for example, it's isn't so easy to transfer an event from one Calendar to another. Honestly, the NextCloud Calendar web app in the browser is probably better. But it's probably not a terrible idea to have this set up anyway (e.g., for offline use).

### Hosts file

    sudo notepad C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
